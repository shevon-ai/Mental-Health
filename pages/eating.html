                Anyone, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, or body type, can develop an eating disorder. Depending on
                the kind of eating disorder, there are different physical, mental, and emotional symptoms from person to
                person. Combining cognitive therapy, medicine, and other therapies may be used in treatment.

                <h2>What is an Eating Disorder?</h2>
                <p>
                    A significant, intricate mental health condition called an eating disorder can have an impact on
                    both one's physical and emotional well-being. Eating disorder sufferers come to have unhealthy
                    connections with food, weight, or attractiveness. Eating disorders include anorexia, bulimia, and
                    binge eating disorder.
                </p>
                <P>
                    EatingÂ disorders can be treated. Untreated eating disorders can lead to serious health issues in a
                    person.

                <h2>Who is at risk for eating disorder?</h2>
                <p>
                    At any age, eating disorders can emerge. All sexes, races, and ethnicities are impacted. The idea
                    that eating disorders mostly afflict girls and women is untrue. Both boys and men are at risk. You
                    may be more vulnerable to having an eating disorder if you have certain conditions, such as:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Family history of eating disorders, addiction, or other mental health issues, such as
                        depression.</li>
                    <li>A history of trauma (physical, emotional or sexual).</li>
                    <li>Personal history of anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</li>
                    <li>History of dieting.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Additional factors include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Diabetes (up to one-fourth of women with Type 1 diabetes develop an eating disorder).</li>
                    <li>Involvement in activities that focus on a slender appearance, such as modeling, gymnastics,
                        swimming, wrestling and running.</li>
                    <li>Major life changes, such as starting a new school or job, a divorce or a move.</li>
                    <li>Perfectionistic tendencies.</li>

                <h2>What are the types of eating disorders?</h2>
                <p>
                    Eating disorders come in a variety of forms. Some people may suffer from several eating disorders. Types include:
                    <br /><br />
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Anorexia nervosa</b>: People who have anorexia nervosa severely restrict their caloric intake
                        and sometimes even starve themselves. Any size body can develop anorexia. It is characterized by
                        an obsession with weight loss and an unwillingness to consume the recommended quantities of food
                        for your body type and level of exercise.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <b>Bulimia nervosa</b>: Bulimia nervosa sufferers binge or overeat, or believe they did, during
                        a short period of time. After that, they could force themselves to get rid of the calories in
                        some other way, including by vomiting, using laxatives, or engaging in excessive exercise.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <b>Binge eating disorder (BED)</b>: A person with a binge eating disorder exhibits a loss of
                        control over their eating. They consume a lot of food in a short length of time, or they think
                        they have. However, they don't expel food or burn off calories through activity after bingeing.
                        Instead, they experience uncomfortable satiety and could battle despair, regret, or guilt.
