                Chronic mood illness called bipolar disorder produces abrupt changes in mood, energy, and behavior. The
                primary symptoms of the illness are manic and hypomanic episodes, and the majority of those who have it
                also experience depressed periods. Medication, talk therapy, lifestyle modifications, and other
                therapies can help you manage the disease.

                <h2>What is a bipolar disorder?</h2>
                <p>
                    Manic-depressive disease, sometimes referred to as bipolar disorder or manic depression, is a
                    chronic mood disorder and mental health condition that produces abrupt changes in mood, energy
                    levels, thought processes, and behavior. These shifts interfere with your ability to do daily duties
                    and can persist for a few minutes or several days, weeks, or even months.
                </p>
                <P>
                    There are a few different varieties of bipolar disorder, which are characterized by severe mood
                    swings known as hypomanic/manic and depressed episodes. Bipolar disorder sufferers don't always
                    experience hypomania, manic episodes, or depression episodes. Euthymia, or times of normal mood, are
                    also experienced by them.

                <h2>Who is at risk for bipolar disorder?</h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone can be impacted by bipolar disorder. The usual age of onset is 25, although it sometimes
                    might occur as young as infancy or as old as your 40s or 50s.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite the fact that bipolar illness affects both AFABs (those designated female at birth) and
                    AMABs (people assigned male at birth), it tends to impact them differently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bipolar disorder patients may experience mood swings more often. Rapid cycling is the term used to
                    describe patients with bipolar illness who have four or more manic or depressed episodes in a
                    calendar year. Variable levels of thyroid and sex hormones, as well as the propensity of AFAB
                    individuals to receive antidepressant prescriptions, might all be factors in this population's more
                    rapid cycling.

                <h2>What are the types of bipolar disorders?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are four types of bipolar disorder, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Bipolar I disorder</b>: Mania episodes have occurred during one or more manic episodes in people
                        with bipolar I illness. Although most patients with bipolar I will have both manic and
                        depressive episodes, a depressive episode is not required for a diagnosis. The depressed bouts
                        often persist for two weeks or longer. Your manic episodes must persist at least seven days or
                        be so severe that you require hospitalization in order to be diagnosed as bipolar I. Mixed
                        states can also be experienced by those with bipolar I. (episodes of both manic and depressive
                        symptoms).
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <b>Bipolar II disorder</b>: Hypomanic and depressed episodes are common in those with bipolar II.
                        However, they never go through a complete manic episode, which is a sign of bipolar I disease.
                        Bipolar II disorder is frequently more incapacitating than bipolar I illness because persistent
                        depression is more prevalent in bipolar II, even if hypomania is less incapacitating than mania.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <b>Cyclothymic disorder (cyclothymia)</b>: Cyclothymic disorder patients have persistent mood
                        instability. They go through moderate sadness and hypomania for at least two years. Euthymia, or
                        brief episodes of normal mood, can occur in people with cyclothymia, although they seldom endure
                        more than eight weeks.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <b>Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders</b>: It is referred to as other
                        specified or unspecified bipolar disorder if a person experiences episodes of clinically
                        significant aberrant mood elevation but does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I,
                        II, or cyclothymia.
