            <p>
                A stressful experience may cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition. It
                results in unpleasant, nervous feelings. Some PTSD sufferers repeatedly replay the incident. Others
                steer clear of any reminders of it. PTSD affects relationships, employment, and daily life. However,
                even years later, medicines and counseling can be helpful.

                <h2>What is post-traumatic stress disorder?</h2>
                <p>
                    A unpleasant experience may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health
                    condition. The incident might be risky, fatal, shocking, or even frightful. Examples include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accident.</li>
                    <li>Fire.</li>
                    <li>Military combat.</li>
                    <li>Natural disaster, such as a tornado.</li>
                    <li>Physical abuse.</li>
                    <li>Sexual assault or rape.</li>
                    <li>Sudden death of a loved one.</li>
                    <li>Terrorist attack.</li>
                </ul>
                <P>
                    You could have personally experienced the traumatic event or you might have witnessed it happen to
                    someone else.
                </P>
                <p>
                    After an event like that, it's common to feel angry. For a period, you might struggle to get enough
                    rest, eat, or engage in activities you find enjoyable. However, PTSD symptoms interfere with your
                    life and continue for more than a few months.

                <p>
                    It is impossible to foresee who would get PTSD after a severe incident. However, PTSD is more
                    prevalent among those who have gone through:

                <ul>
                    <li>Certain types of trauma, particularly military combat or sexual assault.</li>
                    <li>Injury during the event.</li>
                    <li>Lack of support from loved ones after a traumatic event.</li>
                    <li>Long-lasting or repeated trauma.</li>
                    <li>Personal history of anxiety or depression, even before the traumatic event.</li>
                    <li>Strong initial reaction to the event (for example, shaking or throwing up).</li>
                    <li>Very intense trauma.</li>

                <h2>What are the types of PTSD?</h2>
                <p>
                    PTSD is a multidimensional condition with a wide range of potential origins and effects. Five
                    distinct subcategories that call for various treatment modalities are the subject of recent
                    research.
                    <br /><br />
                    Types of PTSD include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Normal Stress Response</b>: This response can result from incidents like car accidents,
                        injuries, diseases, surgeries, and other sources of excessive tension and stress. Prior to the
                        onset of PTSD, a normal stress reaction takes place. It does not always result in the full-blown
                        condition, though. Within a few weeks, those who are experiencing a typical stress reaction
                        should feel better.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <b>Acute Stress Disorder</b>: When someone is exposed to a situation that poses a serious risk
                        to their life, acute stress disorder might develop. Acute stress disorder can be brought on by
                        natural calamities, the death of close ones, or job losses. Acute stress disorder may really
                        progress to PTSD if neglected.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <b>Uncomplicated PTSD</b>: One significant traumatic experience, as opposed to several, is the
                        cause of uncomplicated PTSD. The simplest type of PTSD to treat is this one. Uncomplicated PTSD
                        symptoms include avoiding reminders of the traumatic incident, nightmares, flashbacks,
                        irritability, mood swings, and changes in relationships. Treatment options for PTSD include
                        counseling, medication, or a combination of the two.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <b>Complex PTSD</b>: Uncomplicated PTSD is the antithesis of complex PTSD. Multiple traumatic
                        incidents, rather than just one, are what lead to complex PTSD. Complex PTSD sufferers may also
                        have dissociative disorders, borderline or antisocial personality disorders, or both. They
                        display problematic behaviors including impulsivity, aggressiveness, and substance addiction.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <b>Comorbid PTSD</b>: Comorbid PTSD is a blanket term for co-occurring disorders. PTSD is a
                        blanket term for co-occurring disorders. It is applied when a person has more than one mental
                        health concern, often coupled with substance abuse issues. Using drugs or alcohol as a way to
                        numb the pain will only make things worse and prolong treatment.
