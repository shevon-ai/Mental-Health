                Anxiety disorders fall within the category of mental health issues. It's challenging to get through the
                day
                when you're anxious. Sweating and a fast heartbeat are symptoms, along with feelings of unease, panic,
                and
                terror. Medication and cognitive behavioral therapy are forms of treatment. The ideal treatment plan for
                you
                can be created by your healthcare provider.

                <h2>What is an anxiety disorder?</h2>
                <p>
                    An anxiety disorder is a specific kind of mental illness. If you suffer from an anxiety disorder,
                    you could experience fear and dread in response to particular items and circumstances. Additionally,
                    anxiety can cause bodily symptoms like perspiration and a racing heart.
                </p>
                <P>
                    The presence of some anxiousness is common. If you have to solve an issue at work, attend an
                    interview, take an exam, or make a significant choice, you can experience anxiety or nervousness.
                    And even good things can come from anxiety. For instance, anxiety helps us concentrate our attention
                    and make us aware of potentially harmful circumstances, keeping us safe.
                </P>
                <p>
                    But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time
                    to time. An anxiety disorder happens when:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your ability to do daily tasks is hampered by anxiety.</li>
                    <li>You often overreact when something triggers your emotions.</li>
                    <li>Your reactions to events are beyond your control.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It might be tough to get through the day if you have an anxiety problem. Thankfully, there are a
                    number of efficient therapies available for anxiety disorders.

                <h2>Who is at risk for anxiety disorder?</h2>
                <p>
                    An individual's chance of acquiring anxiety disorders may increase due to a combination of
                    hereditary and environmental variables. If you have experienced or have ever experienced:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Certain psychological qualities, such as shyness or behavioral inhibition, cause people to feel
                        uneasy with strangers and avoid such circumstances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        unpleasant or stressful experiences in adolescence or maturity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anxiety or other mental health disorders run in the family.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Several health ailments, such as thyroid issues and heart arrhythmias (unusual heart rhythms).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Women are more prone to anxiety problems than males. Why that occurs is still being investigated by
                    researchers. It might be a result of a woman's hormones, particularly if they change during the
                    month. Men have higher levels of the hormone testosterone, which may help with anxiety. It's also
                    conceivable that because women are less inclined to seek help, their anxiety gets worse.

                <h2>What are the types of anxiety disorders?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several varieties of anxiety disorders, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Panic disorder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Phobias.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Separation anxiety.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Anxiety disorders have characteristics in common with other mental health diseases. These include
                    obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.
