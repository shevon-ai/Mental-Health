                Your mood and ability to function may be affected by the medical illness known as depression. Clinical
                depression, bipolar depression, dysthymia, seasonal affective disorder, and other kinds of depression
                are among them. Counseling, medicine, brain stimulation, and alternative treatments are all available as
                treatment options.

                <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
                <p>
                    Depression is a medical condition that affects your mood and ability to function.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Feeling depressed might entail sadness, anxiety, or hopelessness. Additionally, the illness may make
                    it difficult to think, remember, eat, and sleep. You must experience these feelings on a daily basis
                    for at least two weeks in order to be diagnosed with severe depressive disorder (clinical
                    depression), which also includes other symptoms such trouble sleeping, a lack of interest in
                    activities, or changes in eating.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Depression may worsen and linger longer if left untreated. In extreme circumstances, it may result
                    in death or self-harm. Fortunately, therapies can significantly reduce depressive symptom severity.
                </p>

                <h2>Who is at risk for depression?</h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody is immune to depression, regardless of their age, gender, or situation. Depression affects
                    over 16 million Americans each year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depression may affect women more frequently than it does males. Additionally, having at least one
                    depressed episode in your lifetime is more likely if you have certain medical problems or genetics.

                <h2>What are the types of depression?</h2>
                <p>
                    Symptoms and causes are used by healthcare professionals to designate different forms of depression.
                    The causes of these occurrences are frequently obscure. They can remain far longer in some persons
                    than in others for no apparent cause.
                    <br /><br />
                    Types of depression include:

                        are severe or overpowering and last for more than two weeks. Everyday living is hampered by
                        these symptoms.
                    </li>
                    <br />

                    </li>

                        happen at any time throughout pregnancy or even up to a year after giving birth. The "baby
                        blues" are only one set of symptoms and only result in mild melancholy, anxiety, or stress.
                    </li>

                        milder than those of major depression. However, PDD symptoms might last for up to two years in
                        some people.
